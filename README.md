# Thinkmill Badges

"Supported by Thinkmill" badge for READMEs.

![Simple badge](simple@1x.png) ![Heart badge](heart@1x.png) ![Rocket badge](rocket@1x.png) ![Invader badge](invader@1x.png)

## Usage

The general usage looks like this: `https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/<type>@1x.png`, where `<type>` is to be replaced with one of:

- `simple`
- `heart`
- `rocket`
- `invader`

Link to `http://thinkmill.com.au` when using these badges, otherwise people who click on them just see a bigger version which is suboptimal.

> There also are 2x versions available (if you have control over the height of the badge use those) by replacing the `@1x` in the URL with `@2x`! For example, `https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart@2x.png` is the 2x version of the heart badge.

For example, to embed the heart badge in a Github README use this snippet: (yes, a limited subset of HTML works on Github in Markdown)

```HTML
<a href="http://thinkmill.com.au">
	<img height="20px" alt="Supported by Thinkmill" src="https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart@2x.png" />
</a>
```

This uses the 2x version scaled down so it looks sharper, has proper alt text for screenreader support and links to `http://thinkmill.com.au`. Perfect! üëç
