![Simple badge](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/simple.svg) ![Heart badge](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart.svg) ![Rocket badge](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/rocket.svg) ![Bolt badge](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/bolt.svg) ![Invader badge](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/invader.svg)

## Usage

The general usage looks like this: `https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/<type>.svg`, where `<type>` is to be replaced with one of:

- `simple`
- `heart`
- `rocket`
- `bolt`
- `invader`


### Best practices

- Link to `http://thinkmill.com.au` when using these badges (otherwise people who click on them just see a bigger version)
- Add "Supported by Thinkmill" as the alt text

### README Snippet

For example, to embed the heart badge in a Github README use this snippet: (yes, a limited subset of HTML works on Github in Markdown)

```HTML
<a href="http://thinkmill.com.au">
	<img alt="Supported by Thinkmill" src="https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart.svg" />
</a>
```

Which looks like this:

<a href="http://thinkmill.com.au">
	<img alt="Supported by Thinkmill" src="https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart.svg" />
</a>

Proper alt text for screenreader support and links to `http://thinkmill.com.au`. Perfect! üëç
